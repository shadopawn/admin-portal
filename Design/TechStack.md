## Unity
https://unity.com/ - We are building off of an existing product that has been built with Unity. For ease of use and because it is what the client wants, we will continue development of the Unity application. 

## React JS
https://www.reactjs.org/ - The admin will need a place to not only create lessons, but also eventually view analytics. It’s possible that more requirements could arise that an admin might have to do. We decided that a React web application would be fit for this part of the requirements. We have someone who is well versed in React, one who is a beginner, and someone who is really excited to learn it. The functionality of the lesson maker and the data visualizations will require more than regular HTML, CSS, and JS, so we believe that this is the best solution for those requirements. 

## Firebase
https://firebase.google.com/ - The Unity application and the React web application are going to need some way to communicate. Firebase is a cloud computing solution with competitive pricing for applications without much data or many read/writes. If the applications used aren’t needing to access the cloud much, then Firebase can even be free. If done well and is used on a higher commercial level, the price should never be above $20 a month for the tasks at hand.

## Github
https://github.com/ - For version control, we will take advantage of Git/Github. This is the version control we are all used to and has a track record of working.

## Freedcamp
https://freedcamp.com/ - This is the client’s preferred project management tool.
