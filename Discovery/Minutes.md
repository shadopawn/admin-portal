## Topics Discussed
- Kyles talked about his own background and how he got here today
  - Graduated from Ball State 12 years ago
  - Didn't like the corporate world so he decided to start his own business
  - At the time streaming was starting to gain popularity, so he founded a business based on helping referees get access to videos to practice with (Zooom App)
- The starting of Refreps
  - His new company created to help train officials
  - Created a game within Unity and Kinect SDK that will test referees and help them learn in the process
  - They have modules with many video in each
  - It is upload to Steam 
- Where we come in
  - Video/lesson editor
    - This is the main priorty of the project, a lesson editor
    - He wants to be able to build and create new lessons for the game
    - Those lessons would be stored somewhere such as a database
    - The game application would at some point, look to the database and be able to pull those new lessons
    - The game application should be able to be played offline, unless needed for updates such as pulling new videos
    - He wants to be able to make these lessons and have them be upload into the game without needed a unity developer to help
  - User Lesson Tracking and Analytics
    - The next priority is user tracking
    - He wants users to be able to track their progress
    - Once they have completed a lesson, that should be stored even when the game resets
    - When they log back in, they should be able I pick up where they left off
    - This can be done locally, but he would want it to eventually be in the cloud
    - He also wants some way to gamify it, but that would be on the lowest of priorities
  - Admin Analytics
    - The lowest priority of the main three
    - He wants to create a place where admins can view data and analyze data coming from the game application
  - Communication
    - The best way to communicate about topics outside the project is email
    - The project management will be done through Freedcamp

## Things Clarified
- He will be setting us up with Freedcamp accounts
- He will give us more information about the previous team's version control
- He will give us contact information of the previous team
- He will have the previous team share the project they have done
- We will meet on Thursday to discuss somehow me might go about the project
