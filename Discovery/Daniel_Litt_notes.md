# Daniel Litt Discovery notes

business called Refreps
    - referee training

needs database to store videos and lessons

wants a lesson creation system that can integrate with unity

Priority
1. lesson builder
2. progress storage
3. analytics

-Lesson editor
-Add some new videos, design lessons.
-Maybe potentially, modify the game to access those new lessons in Unity.
-Track progress of users.
    store locally
    store remotely
    admin access to progress
-Maybe potentially, modify Unity code to show some kind of dashboard for the users.
-Collect statistics.
-We have built a gaming application in Unity. We need a way to upload content (mostly video) in a content management system, ideally through the web, and have the content load into our gaming application. I presume this CMS would need to be custom built, but if there is anything existing that would work, I'm completely fine with considering that.
-We also need to create some sort of database structure that tracks a user's progress through our game and stores data related to their user account. Eventually I would like to create a "reward program" driven by this database.

Wants to gamify it with a leaderboard or achievements

wants the game to ideally function offline
