##Brian Notes
-Get clarification of what training entails for USE1.
-Get away from zoom, something more streamlined, for meetings. Some other communication medium.
-Domain model made more about domain. UML can be a tech stack thing.

-jiraboard- managment tool to help developers track progress of software.
-todo/in progress/optional steps, code review/commits/comments
-utilize our project management tool. Freedcamp.

-Format iterations with "Someone does something, and something happens."

-First iteration should have easier goals, that are more functional for ergin. Foundation building.

##Cody Notes
- stop using Zoom because it cuts out
- use jira board or similar board system (freedcamp)
- external application should handle server communication
- first iteration features might be excessive -- make sure to add most value (agile) or make the database local in first iteration
-Either extending zoom calls or finding an alternative to zoom needs to be high priority. We shouldn't have to cut off meeting like that.
