## Topics Discussed
- Started by asking Evan how his work is going and how he goes about it to get some insight into a career as a professional software developer
- We then started to go over each part of the 8 assignments and some feedback from him
  - Ask more about what they are going to do with the data collect
  - We went over each use case and there are a note about each made within the assignment document 
  - Wanted to go more in depth about how the data is going to be stored and whether it will be uploaded
  - Get clarification of what training entails for USE1.
  - Domain model should make more sense
  - UML can be a tech stack thing.
  - External application should handle server communication
  - Suggested not to use JSON but just use SQL
- first iteration features might be excessive -- make sure to add most value (agile) or make the database local in first iteration
- We should stop using Zoom because it keep cutting us off
- He also suggested that we use a project management tool. We already use Freedcamp so we should probably stick to that

## Things Clarified
- First iteration tasks
- Domain model and UML
- Requirements
